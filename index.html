<h1><font face="Arial" color="white">The Top 3 Best Survival Games of all Time!</h1>


<fun>
  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">We’ve all wondered how we would survive in a life or death situation with nothing but your bits to the wind for company. Scraping by with what little resources you can muster before eventually going on to become the hyper-violent equivalent of Robinson Crusoe. That’s exactly what the best survival games do: make you feel like the ruler of your own cultivated kingdom.<br><br>There’s a belief that a lot of them follow a similar blueprint, faults and all. Many survival games launch in Early Access and refuse to leave for the longest time; a couple of entries on this list are certainly guilty of that.

That said, there are just as many survival games that absolutely flourished in Early Access and continue to receive updates to this day.

<p> 

<p style="font-size: 20px">So lets look at the Best 3 survival game that currenlty exist! <p>

<br><br><br><br><br><br><h1> <p style="font-size: 30px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">No. 3 State of decay</h1>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> State of Decay is, essentially, a zombie survival simulator. Combat is involved, and is in fact a large part of the adventure, but the need to smash open zombie heads simply facilitates the most integral aspect — eking out an existence in a harsh and desolate world. <p>


<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">At first, State of Decay‘s premise seems weak. Combat is rough beyond measure, featuring simplistic button mashing and touchy collision detection, while sneaking around involves crouching and moving very slowly. The enemy A.I. isn’t exactly up to snuff, either — a zombie could be chasing you, and literally watch you crouch into some bushes, but it forgets you exist the moment you’re in there. The introductory sequence lasts just long enough for one to believe this is all there is to it, but just before one’s tempted to throw in the towel, it becomes so much more. <p>

<p>  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"> By searching areas within buildings, players can find weapons, health items, and valuable resources to strap on their backs and bring home. Resources consist of food, medicine, ammunition, building materials, and fuel, with each one having its own use. Searching can take a while, but you can speed up the process — at the risk of creating loud noises and drawing a small army of the undead. This type of compromise is common in State of Decay — trading quicker rewards for risks that could prove costly. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Running up a snowy mountain firing a machine gun at a woolly mammoth from the back of a tyrannosaurus is a fantastic example of the reason many video games exist: living out ridiculous childhood fantasies. ARK: Survival Evolved has plenty of that to go around across its multiple sprawling maps - which it calls ARKs - which can be explored solo or crowded with up to 100 players. Some lingering technical issues, bad dino AI, and an extreme amount of grinding to reach endgame are the main factors keeping it from being as sharp in the tooth as it could be. <p>

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Like many of the survival/crafting games of the genre it partially helped popularize, ARK dumps you on the beaches of a massive, foreboding island with just enough clothing to stay modest and your own two fists. From there, the challenge is to stay fed and hydrated while avoiding a huge variety of terrifyingly detailed dinosaurs and other beasts long enough to progress up the tech tree. Early in the life of a character, you might be taking out dilophosaurs with throwing spears and hoping a triceratops doesn’t come and knock your thatch hut over in the middle of the night.<br><br>From there, there’s a really nice flow of technological progression that makes advancement feel like more than just an increase in stats. Thirty hours later, you may preside from a sturdy stone castle from atop which you snipe pterasaurs out of the air with a rifle. By the endgame, it’s possible to have a massive steel fortress full of blast furnaces, complete with electric lighting and gas generators, churning out components for building rocket launchers and SCUBA gear.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white"><strong>What is it?</strong> Minecraft's legacy is one of infinite stories of friendship, creativity, and inclusivity. Anybody can play Minecraft, and almost anybody can find something to love about it. Minecraft is more than a blocky survival game that lets you build things.

  <p style="font-size: 20px"> <font face="Arial" color="white">Initially released to the world in 2009 as an ambitious project from a small indie team, Minecraft sought to combine a collection of half-baked ideas in the video games industry into the quintessential creative survival sandbox game. Over a decade later, Mojang Studios has grown exponentially larger under Microsoft's wing, evolving far beyond anyone believed it would when it originally launched.<br><br>Frankly, it would be easy for me to assert that Minecraft deserves to be described as one of the best Xbox games and best PC games solely on its merit as a video game, but Minecraft has expanded beyond that reach to become a platform of creativity, education, and inclusivity.<br><br>Today, the original Minecraft game exists as two separate versions, with so much hidden just below the surface. The first is Bedrock Edition, which exists on every platform imaginable, including Xbox Game Pass on consoles, and features full cross-play and cross-save support through your Microsoft account. It also empowers creators and lets the Minecraft community support each other with the ever-growing Minecraft Marketplace, which is filled with new ways to play and customize.<br><br>It's all of this and more that comes together to create "Minecraft," and it's pretty amazing. Whether or not you personally love Minecraft or play it yourself, the effects it has on this awesome industry are irrefutable and insurmountable. It's for these reasons that I firmly believe that Minecraft is certainly, absolutely, indubitably the greatest game ever made.
